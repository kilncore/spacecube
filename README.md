# spacecube
Idea exploration for a common platform for large payloads into space

SpaceCUBE is currently at the idea stage. It is more of a placeholder than anything.

We think it is necessary for interoperation to have fixed locations for raw material supply, and for foreseeable interconnections for exchanging heat, power, and extracted resources.

As standards will emerge for the lunar economy, we will update the interconnections plate and the general size. We do believe that using a shipping container as the basic building block would help the international community to contribute to a future lunar base, as it would simplify the cost of moving cargo to the launch provider: once Starship is operational, that cost won't be so negligible. It also makes sharing prototypes much easier, and the SpaceCUBE foundation could be reusable from project to project.

If SpaceX proposes a standard rideshare cargo size, we will update the plans here.
